                        <p>
                            In my role as a Project Program Manager at OGAV I was involved in budget formation,  planning and organizing programs for the organization, as well as hiring and training volunteers and staff for various positions within the organization.
                            During my one year work at OGAV, I manage a co-curricular project in 7 schools with 560 girls as direct beneficiary where I coordinate activities of volunteers, allocate resources and supplies to ensure volunteers complete their responsibilities. 
                            Working with a team of 5 persons we teach and facilitate training for girls in secondary schools and also develop reports on ongoing programs that was submitted to the management while coordinating daily schedules. 
                            As the PM, I support and connect with other NGOs/attend meetings and programs, and draw up a work schedule for the week, while keeping a record of inventories.  I managed and coordinated office operations while participating in designing and development of bursary, scholarship plan, training modules, filing, reporting, auditing bank account, financial management, bank cheques and documentation for the organization.
                            In my last months at the organization, I coordinated and managed the annual summer camp with other team members. A project tagged Menstrual Poverty Hygiene for 1000 girls in Education District 1 at the Government Girls College, during the event I coordinated the planning, process, secured event location, connect with speakers/facilitators/vendors, worked with the 18 schools counselor to get the students present at the event. 
                            At the end of the event, I prepared reports for each of the stakeholders; media, Education District, management and Lagos State Ministry of Education. Evaluation and analysis of the project was also implemented.
